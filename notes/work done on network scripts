The process of writing/modifying the network communications portion of the ob project is documented here.
Using Python3.5, from each RPi, and 3.6 from our laptop 'Len', and all from identical virtual environments(venvs), that is, 
each device using identical requirements.txt files or matching lists of dependancies in configuring their venvs thus insuring that
no conflicts occur,i.e. app versions,etc.
Then we established communications between the three devices using ssh, at first on a local area network.
