owlbox project plan:

-description



The project will create a network of barn owl nesting habitats within the crop fields of an urban farm for the purposes of pest control, public education and IoT node prototyping. A total of five owlboxes will be specifically placed among the crops, as to provide an overlapping coverage of owl/network range.
