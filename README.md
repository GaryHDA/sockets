# sockets
The communication part of the Owl Box Project, here we establish the prototypes' network communication sockets with 
Python 3.5 and 3.6.



two RPi 3 model B running Raspian Stretch
one picamera
and one laptop running "Ubuntu 18.10"

Identical environments were set up on each device using Pipenv v2018.11.26
From within the virtual environment, all subsequent work is done, on every device, from just the laptop via ssh.

The RPi3Bs were selected after considering:

Economy- at 32$ each, plus 25$ for camera component, and another 20$ for the pair of microSD cards.

Utility- built-in wifi, bluetooth, 4 usb ports, 24 GPIO pins, ethernet port.

Versatility- for various projects, the RPi is a great starting point.
