owlbox project plan:

-description



The project will create a network of barn owl nesting habitats within the crop fields of an urban farm for
the purposes of pest control, public education and IoT node prototyping.Each box will house a micro computer, 
two cameras(one facing down into the nest area, the other facing outwards to the fields), and a power source such as a 
battery pack and solar.
A total of five owlboxes will be  placed among the crops to provide an overlapping coverage of predator range.The targeted prey 
are gophers and voles.


Project components include:

-Habitat boxes/device housing

-Network interface devices in a weatherproof enclosure(includes all necessary hardware,such as RPi's,cameras and cables)

-Software will include all device firmware,operating system,web applications,and network scripting(Raspian,Linux,Apache2,Python3.6-3.7,etc.)

-Power supply and management(includes any batteries,solar panels and the necessary power regulation system)

-Mounting systems,such as durable masts, or poles(includes weatherproof roof structures,etc.)
  

-Timeline for implementation of project phases

1.Planning phase to determine all project needs,such as materials lists,site selection,budget and time allocation.
2.Build phase(includes prototype assembly, and testing)
3.Installation phase
4.Project review phase
